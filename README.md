# SQL-Rockbuster_Video

Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores worldwide. Facing competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team plans to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

## Key Questions

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
